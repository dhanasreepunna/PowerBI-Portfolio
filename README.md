## Support system Dashboard
### Objective:

To analyze category-wise support ticket performance, monitor unnecessary reassignment of tickets, measure average resolution time, and identify top and bottom issue categories to improve operational efficiency and SLA compliance.

The dashboard focuses on first-time resolution quality, ensuring that raised tickets should resolved or rejected directly without reassignment.

📊 Key Performance Areas Covered

🔹 Category-wise Raised Tickets: Shows the volume of tickets raised per category (Quality, Progress, Drawing, Contract, etc.).

🔹 Reassigned Tickets (Process Leakage Indicator): Tracks how many tickets were reassigned after being raised.

🔹 Average Resolution Time by Category: Measures the average time taken to close a ticket per category.

🔹 First Attempt Closed Tickets: Indicates how many tickets were closed without reassignment or reopening. Serves as a quality-of-resolution metric.

🚀 Business Value

Improves first-time resolution rate.

Reduces unnecessary ticket reassignment.

Identifies root causes of recurring issues.
